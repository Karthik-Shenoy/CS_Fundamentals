# Pointers

## pass by value and pass by reference (for pointers)
- whenever we pass a pointer/reference to a function we will be passing a copy of the pointer (the copy pointer points to the same memory location)
- to pass by reference we can either use `PlaceHolder "&"` or use a `pointer to pointer`

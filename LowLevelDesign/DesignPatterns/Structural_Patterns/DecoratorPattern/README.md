# The decorator pattern
- Used when the object requires new functionality dynamically during runtime 
- Decorator is a wrapper object, which wraps a given object and adds extra functionality to the object
- Both decorators(wrappers) and the object they wrap implement the same abstract-class/interface, this allows us to wrap decorators inside decorators (recursive wrapping)

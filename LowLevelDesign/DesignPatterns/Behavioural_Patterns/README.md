# Behavioural Pattern

## iterator pattern
- `Collection` : is a container for group of objects (Lists, Queues, Graphs, Trees, Matrices etc)
- The traversal of the container may contain complex logic (BFS/DFS), adding traversal algorithms might `blur` the responsibility of the collection (store/dispose the group of objects)

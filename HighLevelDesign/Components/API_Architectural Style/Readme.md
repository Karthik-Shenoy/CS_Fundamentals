# Architectural style
There are 2 different approaches when it comes to design of architecture
- `start with an empty slate`, and go on building the system using familiar components until we end up with an intended system (the constraints are kept in mind while building the system)
- `second approach : ` we start with all the components needed by the system as a whole without any constraints, and incrementally apply constraints and eliminate control/data flow paths
